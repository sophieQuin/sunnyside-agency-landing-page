## Overview

This project was a good way to test my understanding of :
Box Model
Flexbox
CSS positioning
HTML Sementic elements
Visual Studio Code

### The challenge

- Make the website responsive (Tablets and mobiles)
- Make the website interactive (with the use of :hover and drop down menu)


## My process

Studying Figma's prototype of the project

Planning on how to approach different sections of the web page

Reproducing the header section of the page by building blocks, followed by its text and logo. Ensuring it remains responsive and accessibility is respected by using the appropriate tag.

Following the same method for each part of the page (Adverstising section, Testimonials section, Gallery section and footer section).

Ensuring all the comments are clear and highlight the different section of the page.

Finish the project by applying all the styling.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts
- Javascript
- Git version control


### What I learned

Test my understanding of CSS positioning (relative and absolute)
Refine my knowledge of flexbox and Media Query
Consider planning as a vital part of the process
Come up with a method of working : building blocks first before worrying about the styling, so that I can be satisfied with how they affect each other.


### Continued development

In the future I shall:

Spend more time in planning before tackling the challenge

Use positioning more efficiently
